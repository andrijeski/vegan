# Vegan Resources

Recently, some nice unknown person from Reddit shared this list with me. I decided to share it along and maybe expand it further.
<br><br>
The list contain some handy information for recent vegans or just people looking to go vegan. It may also be useful as a general information for curious people.

**April 2021 Update**:
<br><br>
Added a new list called _products-we-use_. 
It's a list of supplements and products we often use. It is very specific as I don't want to add obvious things like 'broccoli' or 'pasta'. <br>
It may help someone else finding a nice/tasty product or serve as a reminder for common supplements people should ingest.
