Eating vegan at fast food restaurants:

http://www.peta.org/living/food/chain-restaurants/

And of course you should be able to get tofu/bean curd at Chinese restaurants. And bean burritos at Mexican places. And a pizza shop could definitely make you a marinara pie/slice if you asked. Italian restaurants always have pasta with marinara or garlic and oil. And Middle Eastern places should have falafel. You could also always carry some trail mix or maybe a Clif Bar with you so if you end up in a situation where there's absolutely nothing vegan you won't starve.
